# Question: 

**Does a change in Adult-sized catch impact predictions for the different size-classes?**

# Answer: 

**Only very large changes, and only for the immediately impacted year.**

# General Approach:

 1. Train the "currently in use" machine learning model on all data fromm the years 1982-2012.    
 2. Generate testing datasets containing adjusted landings data   
 3. Adjustments performed on actual landings data over a range of values for age 3+ fish for 2012, 2013 & 2014 separately
 4. Two treatment methods were tried:   
    a. multiplicative adjustment: $(observed * x_1, x_2, ... x_i)$    
    b. additive adjustment: $(observed + x_1, x_2, ... x_i)$

## Additive Treatment

```{r}
add_10000 %>% kable(caption = "10,000 Added to Age 3+ fish for 2012") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```

## Multiplicative Treatment

```{r}
mult_100 %>% kable(caption = "Observed Landings for 2012 * 100 for Age 3+ Fish") %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped")
```
